# Newlight: A Hypothetical Lighting Store

### Overview

Newlight is a modern e-commerce website for a hypothetical lighting store, built with **Angular** and **TypeScript**. This project serves as a demonstration of core Angular functionalities, leveraging a **mobile-first design** philosophy to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices. It features a cart, search feature and more core functionalities as the project is scaled.

The application currently uses hardcoded data, with a future goal of scaling to a full-stack solution using a **Python** backend and a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Supabase**. The deployment is managed through **Vercel**, streamlining the development and release process.

This project was developed to showcase proficiency in **Angular's reactive features** with **RxJs**, advanced **TypeScript data structures**, and the integration of **Angular Material** for a polished UI/UX.
